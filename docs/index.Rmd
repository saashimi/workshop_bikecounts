This document summarizes the work that was completed during the Introduction to Scientific Computing for Planners, Engineers, and Scientists course offered by 
PSU in August 2018.

###Data Loading
We first needed to specify the packages that we would be working with.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Next, we created a function that would load bike count data in Excel format.
Note that the `date` column was mutated in order to simplify later joining with
weather data.

```{r}
load_bridge <- function(bridge_name) {
  bridge_data <- read_excel(
    "../data/Hawthorne Tilikum Steel daily bike counts 073118.xlsx",
    sheet = bridge_name, skip = 1)
  bridge_data <- add_column(bridge_data, name = bridge_name) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = '%m/%d/%Y'))
  return(bridge_data)
}

bridges <- c("Hawthorne", "Tilikum", "Steel")
all_bridges <-  lapply(bridges, load_bridge)
Hawthorne <- all_bridges[[1]] %>% 
  rename(westbound = `north side (westbound)`) %>%
  rename(eastbound = `south side (eastbound)`) 

Tilikum <-  all_bridges[2]

Steel <- all_bridges[[3]] %>%
  select(-c(`River Walk (lower 2-way)`)) %>% 
  rename(westbound = `north side (westbound)`) %>%
  rename(eastbound = `south side (eastbound)`) 
```
Next, we needed to join bridge and weather data along the date columns.
```{r, message=FALSE}
weather_data_csv <- read_csv("../data/NCDC-CDO-USC00356750.csv") %>% 
  select(-c(STATION, NAME))
  
consolidated_bridge <- bind_rows(Hawthorne, Tilikum, Steel)

all_data <- left_join(consolidated_bridge, weather_data_csv, by = c("date" = "DATE"))
```

### Visualizing data with ggplot2
We were able to visualize data using the recommended ggplot package. We looked
at total bicycle ridership counts plotted as a function of total precipitation
for that day.

```{r}
all_data %>%
 ggplot(aes(x=PRCP, y=total, color=name)) + 
 theme_minimal() +
 geom_point(size=.5) +
 stat_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", aes(group=1), 
             size=1, color="black") +
 labs(title= "Total Bike Counts by Precipitation") +
 scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

We may be used to rain, but not enough for most of us to ride our bikes in it!

### Visualizing the new Tilikum Bridge ridership with the neighboring Hawthorne Bridge.

How does the new bike-and-transit Tilikum Bridge square against the older 
Hawthorne Bridge? We took a look at that.

```{r}
tilikum_open <- all_data  %>%
  filter(name == 'Hawthorne' | name == 'Tilikum')  

tilikum_open %>%  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=total, color=name)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point(size=.5) +
  stat_smooth(data=subset(all_data, name == "Hawthorne"), method=lm, se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", aes(group=1), 
              size=1, color="black") +
  labs(title= "Total Bike Counts over Time") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

There appears to be a noticeable decline in ridership on the Hawthorne Bridge
after the Tilikum Bridge opened.

### Further investigating the effect of the Tilikum Bridge on the Hawthorne Bridge

We could take a more in-depth look at how the opening of the new Tilikum Bridge
in 2015 affected ridership on the Hawthorne Bridge. We needed to approach
the Hawthorne Bridge data as a time series.

We needed to load a new library that will work with this time series data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggfortify)
```

Filtering out for Hawthorne Bridge data, we can then address seasonality.

```{r, message=FALSE}
Hawthorne_series <- all_data %>%
  filter(name == "Hawthorne") %>% 
  select(date, total, name) %>% 
  group_by(date) 

hawthorne_ts <- ts(Hawthorne_series$total, start=2012, frequency=365)
autoplot(stl(hawthorne_ts, s.window = 'periodic'), ts.colour = 'blue')
```

When accounting for seasonality effects, it's clear that the September 2015 opening of the Tilikum Bridge had an effect on reducing bike ridership on the 
Hawthorne Bridge. 

### Applying linear regression models using a split-apply-combine approach
#### Or: The trouble with tibbles!

We learned how to nest tibbles within tibbles!

![(No, not tribbles.)](../data/ST_TroubleWithTribbles.jpg)

Again, we have to load some new libraries.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(broom)
```

Then, apply a linear regression to all these datafiles.
```{r}
# Linear regression application function
tot_vs_weather <- function(df) {
  lm(total ~ TMIN + TMAX + PRCP, data = df) %>% 
  summary()
}

# Nest the data
all_data_nested <- all_data %>% 
    nest(-name)

# Apply the linear regression model
weather_model <- all_data_nested %>% 
  mutate(fit = purrr::map(data, tot_vs_weather),
         tidy = purrr::map(fit, tidy)) %>% 
  select(name, tidy) %>%
  unnest(tidy)
```
Note the `unnest(tidy)` to unpack the nested tibbles, so that it's not tibbles
all the way down.
